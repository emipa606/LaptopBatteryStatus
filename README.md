# LaptopBatteryStatus

Shows your laptop battery status in the game, hopefully this will help you save before you run out of power.
Changes color based on laptop percent batterypower left, limits configurable in the mod-settings.
There are options for colors based on if the battery is currently charging or is already fully charged.
Also an optional autosave when below a defined percent, to the filename "Battery at X%".

If you use this mod on a computer without a battery, it will just show ”No battery” instead.

On most platforms, this mod uses a built in function of Unity (Rimworld's framework). When running on a SteamDeck in SteamOS, Unity's battery functions don't provide accurate information, so the mod now uses information exposed by the Linux kernel via sysfs.
